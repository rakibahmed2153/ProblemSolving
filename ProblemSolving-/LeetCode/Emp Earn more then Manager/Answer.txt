I have used the inner join to join the same table to get the manager salary and details then use the condition to find out the prefered one.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select emp.name as Employee from Employee emp INNER JOIN Employee mp ON emp.managerId = mp.id where emp.salary > mp.salary
